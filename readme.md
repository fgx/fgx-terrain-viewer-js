====================================================================================

Live Demo: [FGx Terrain Viewer JS]( http://fgx.github.io/fgx-terrain-viewer-js/index.html "Happ viewing!" )

- very preliminary

## Concept
3D Globe data viewer for FGx Terrain data.

## Notes
In the right hand dropdown note: FGx Terrain > displays heightmaps as bitmaps

This release does not yet support the crucial data interpolation feature that will be needed to view 3D data above zoom level 7.

This release does dot yet support reading heightmaps and translating the data to 3D meshes.
