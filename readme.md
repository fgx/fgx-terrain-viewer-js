* First crack at getting Yves' data on line in 3D.
* Camera target point is hard-wired for each zoom level. 
* Generally aims towards Port au Prince except for zoom level 5.
 
Nice Height Maps

## Concept
Mission
Provide data viewers for FGx Terrain height map data in JavaScript as 3D globes and as flat maps with 3D elevations.


## Notes
In the right hand dropdown note: FGx Terrain > displays heightmaps as bitmaps

This release does not yet support the crucial data interpolation feature that will be needed to view 3D data above zoom level 7.

This release does dot yet support reading heightmaps and translating the data to 3D meshes.
